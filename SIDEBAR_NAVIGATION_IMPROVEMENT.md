# EstateCore Sidebar Navigation Improvement

## ✅ **SIDEBAR CLEANUP COMPLETED**

### **🎯 Problem Solved:**
The original sidebar had 28+ individual navigation items scattered across 7 different sections, making navigation cluttered and difficult to use. Users had to scroll through a very long list to find specific features.

### **💡 Solution Implemented:**
Created a clean, organized dropdown-based navigation system that groups related functionality into logical categories with expandable/collapsible sections.

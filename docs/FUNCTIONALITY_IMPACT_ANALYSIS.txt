BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
==========================

IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES:
- Complete system downtime
- No user access to any features
- Data inaccessible
- Revenue collection halted
- Property management operations stopped

OPERATIONAL IMPACT:
- Property managers cannot access tenant information
- Tenants cannot pay rent online
- Maintenance requests cannot be tracked
- Communication systems down
- Reporting completely unavailable

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
- Revenue collection disrupted
- Operational efficiency lost
- Customer satisfaction at risk
- Potential data loss concerns
- Recovery time costs

RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS:
=====================

CRITICAL PATH TO RESTORATION:
1. Fix import conflicts (estatecore_backend/models/__init__.py)
2. Create missing LPREvent model or remove dependencies
3. Standardize database configuration
4. Resolve dependency conflicts
5. Test basic application startup

ESTIMATED RECOVERY TIME:
- Critical fixes: 2-4 hours
- Basic functionality restoration: 4-8 hours  
- Full system verification: 8-12 hours
- Complete testing and validation: 12-16 hours

PRIORITY RANKING:
================
1. CRITICAL: Database and import conflicts (blocks everything)
2. HIGH: Missing models and configurations (prevents startup)
3. MEDIUM: Security and dependency issues (affects stability)
4. LOW: Code organization and cleanup (affects maintenance)

CONCLUSION:
===========
The EstateCore system is in a COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL state. 
ALL business-critical functionalities are unavailable due to 
fundamental configuration and import issues. 

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED to restore any level of service.
No workarounds possible until core issues are resolved.

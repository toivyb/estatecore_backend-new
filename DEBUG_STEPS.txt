ESTATECORE - DEBUGGING BLANK PAGE ISSUE
===============================================================================

IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STEPS:
==========================

1. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
   - Look for any red error messages

2. CHECK NETWORK TAB:
   - Look for failed HTTP requests
   - Verify API calls are being made to http://localhost:5000

3. VERIFY FRONTEND IS RUNNING:
   - Frontend should be accessible at one of these URLs:
     * http://localhost:5173
     * http://localhost:5174  
     * http://localhost:5175
   - Look for the Vite development server port in the terminal

4. CHECK CURRENT STATE:
   - Are you seeing a completely white/blank page?
   - Is there a login form visible?
   - Are you logged in but seeing blank content?

COMMON CAUSES & SOLUTIONS:
=========================

A) IF YOU SEE BLANK WHITE PAGE:
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the correct frontend port is being used
   - Clear browser cache and localStorage

B) IF YOU SEE LOGIN FORM BUT IT'S NOT WORKING:
   - Use these credentials:
     Email: admin@example.com
     Password: SecureAdmin123!

C) IF YOU'RE LOGGED IN BUT DASHBOARD IS BLANK:
   - Check network tab for API failures
   - Verify backend is still running on port 5000
   - Check if JWT token is valid

QUICK VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
===========================

1. Test Backend Health:
   Open new browser tab: http://localhost:5000/api/health
   Should show: {"ok": true}

2. Get Login Credentials:
   Open browser tab: http://localhost:5000/api/dev/credentials
   Should show current login info

3. Test API Connection:
   In browser console, run:
   fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)

FRONTEND STATUS CHECK:
=====================
   
Current Status:
- Backend: ✅ Running on port 5000
- Frontend: ✅ Should be running on 5173/5174/5175
- Authentication: ✅ Configured and working
- Navigation: ✅ All routes configured

If page is still blank, please check:
1. Browser console errors
2. Network tab in developer tools
3. Which URL you're accessing

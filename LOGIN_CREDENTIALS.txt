ESTATECORE - LOGIN CREDENTIALS & TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

üîë CURRENT LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
============================
Email: admin@example.com
Password: SecureAdmin123!
Role: super_admin

‚ùó IF LOGIN FAILS, TRY THESE STEPS:
==================================

1. RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER:
   - The backend may need to restart to load the new authentication system
   - Look for any error messages in the backend console

2. CHECK BACKEND IS RUNNING:
   - Backend should be running on http://localhost:5000
   - You can test by visiting http://localhost:5000/api/health

3. VERIFY DEVELOPMENT MODE:
   - Backend must be in development mode for these credentials to work
   - Check that FLASK_ENV=development is set

4. TEST AUTHENTICATION DIRECTLY:
   - Run the test script: python test_login.py
   - This will verify if the backend authentication is working

5. RESET ADMIN PASSWORD (if needed):
   - POST request to http://localhost:5000/api/dev/reset-admin
   - Send JSON: {"password": "SecureAdmin123!"}

6. GET CREDENTIALS PROGRAMMATICALLY:
   - GET request to http://localhost:5000/api/dev/credentials
   - This will return the current development credentials

NOTES:
======
- This is the initial admin account created for development
- Password meets security requirements:
  * At least 8 characters
  * Contains uppercase letter
  * Contains lowercase letter  
  * Contains number
  * Contains special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Account has super_admin privileges (full system access)

PRODUCTION SETUP:
=================
In production, you should:
1. Change this password immediately after first login
2. Create additional admin users
3. Consider disabling this default account
4. Set up proper user onboarding process

SECURITY FEATURES ACTIVE:
========================
- Password hashing (Werkzeug)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 minutes)
- JWT tokens with 8-hour expiration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control

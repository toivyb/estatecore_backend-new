CONCLUSION
===============================================================================

The EstateCore project shows functional promise but requires significant security 
hardening and architectural improvements before production deployment. The 8 critical 
security vulnerabilities pose immediate risk and must be addressed before any 
production use.

The authentication bypass vulnerability is the most concerning finding, as it could 
allow complete system compromise. Immediate action is required on all critical 
security issues.

With proper remediation following this analysis, the project can become a secure, 
scalable real estate management platform. However, the current state presents 
unacceptable security risks for handling sensitive real estate and financial data.
